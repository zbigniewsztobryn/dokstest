### &nbsp;&nbsp;What do I do?
<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
&emsp; Professionally I am architect. Since it's been so much repetative task to handle every day, I started to work on more custom solutions. Started with scripts which could handle such tasks, then I wrote more advanced objects. Finally I decided to develop web application to manage data in our architecture projects. This is how I started my journey with programming and databases. Since 2 years I work in <b>GDL</b>, <b>SQL</b>, and <b>Python</b> to make my daily routines easier.

&emsp;I discovered how powerful such tools could be. This is how I became passionate about the programming. Then I decided to become more concentrated on it and I took <b>Data Science</b> studies on <b>Warsaw University of Technology</b>. Since that time I have put lot of efforts on getting skills necessary in Data Science field such as <b>AWS</b>, <b>Tableau</b>, <b>SAS</b> and <b>Spark</b>.
